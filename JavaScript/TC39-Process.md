# Process

Process: https://tc39.github.io/process-document/
Proposals: https://github.com/tc39/proposals

## Stage 0: Strawman.

WHAT: A free form way of submitting ideas for evolving ECMAScript.  
NEXT: Must be reviewed at a TC39 meeting.

## Stage 1: Proposal.

WHAT: A formal proposal for the feature  
NEXT: Although it does say "free form" in Stage 0. It probably isn't that easy to just 
get something actually proposed. You'll need a champion, whom has to be a member
of TC39 and whom takes responsibility.  
The proposal should contain a description, examples, potential obstacles
and polyfills and demos are needed. But major changes are still to be expected
before making it into the next stage.

## Stage 2: Draft.

WHAT: A first version of the specification. At this point, it will probably make it to the standard.
It contains a formal description of syntax and semantics and two experimental implementations
(one for example in Babel). Only incremental changes are to be expected.

## Stage 3: Candidate.

WHAT: A mostly finished proposal and awaiting feedback from implementations and users.  
NEXT: Designated reviewers appointed by TC39 and the ECMAScript spec editor must sign it off.
There must be at least two spec-compliant implementations (they can be behind a feature flag).
Changes should be made only in response to critical issues.


## Stage 4: Finished.

WHAT: Ready to be included in the standard.  
It includes "Test 262" acceptance tests which two spec-compliant implementations pass.
The proposal may now be included during the yearly ECMAScript specification standard ratification.
