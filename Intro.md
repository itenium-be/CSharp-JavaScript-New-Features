I am Van Schandevijl Wouter. Last year I started itenium with my colleague Steven Robijns.
itenium is an IT Consultancy specialized in .NET & JavaScript. 


JavaScript
----------

Because this is the Visual Studio UserGroup, let's start with ECMAScript.

ECMAScript2015 (ES6) came 6 years after ES5 and contained a whole lot of new features
like arrow functions, let and const, destructuring, template literals, classes, promises, ...
We won't be covering these today but if you think you might have missed some of these
or want to freshen up your knowledge, take a look at http://es6-features.org

Because 6 years is a long time to wait on new JavaScript features the TC39 would do
a yearly ractification and add those features that made it to the final stage of the process.

We will be covering the proposals that made it to Stage 4 and have been included
in the last couple years.

To state the obvious, you'll need polyfills and/or transpilation (be it Babel or TypeScript)
to run this in non-modern browsers.
